Tutorial In this 3-hour long tutorial, we will explore the field of Causality, the state of the art, difficulties in benchmarking studies, and learn how to utilize CausalBench to facilitate comparative and transparent benchmarking. Read the tutorial paper here . Tutorial Abstract Recent advances in causal machine learning introduced a plethora of new causal discovery and causal inference models to tackle decision support problems. Yet, these models exhibit different performance when they train on different data, and even different hardware/software platforms, making it challenging for users to select the appropriate setup pertinent to their specific problem instance. The situation is complicated by the fact that, until recently, the field lacked a unified, publicly available, and configurable platform that supports all major causal inference tasks, including causal discovery, causal effect estimation, and causal inference. CausalBench is a comprehensive benchmarking tool for causal machine learning that facilitates accurate and reproducible benchmarking of causal models across metrics and deployment contexts and helps users to select the most appropriate set up (such as hyper-parameter configuration) for the specific problem setting. This tutorial is intended to familiarize attendees from diverse backgrounds, who are interested in causal learning models and with the capabilities of CausalBench. The tutorial begins with an introduction to \"causality\" and causal machine learning, and then provides hands-on experience with CausalBench to equip attendees with the knowledge necessary to utilize CausalBench for their causal learning problems. Tutorial Material We provide several tutorial materials below for your convenience and reference. These materials may be updated in the future to provide the best CausalBench experience. Slides You may access the slides here. Quickstart file (Google Colab) For your convenience, we have provided two Python Notebook files that can be run on Google Colab. CausalBench Tutorial File , *this file will be utilized through the hands-on tutorial.
